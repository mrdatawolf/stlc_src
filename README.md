Known Issues:
1. Sales Orders tab uses an empty A,B,C,D as a shorthand for the columns being repeats of the higher ones.  This needs to be mimiced on import.
2. FL. GA RATES needs to be split into 3 sections (Floridia, Georgia and Alabama) then imported
3. starting with line 21 in Sales TMC sheet the input data is messed up.

Questions:
1. Sales Orders mill is sometimes a formula and sometime a static number or even empty.  So M-L unless it's over-ridden?
2. Since random is being used by GSWP and public, I need the business logic for these sheets if we want to pull them in.
3. If GRAYSON RATES needs to be brought in then I need the business logic behind the columns.

Should these sheets be brought in?
1. ship request
2. CAPS and CAPS(2)
3. Sun
4. Milling
5. Blank
6. notes
7. person notes
8. shipping screwups
9. WOOD MANAGER
10. GSWp non-vmi contract.
11. insurance

2. gray notes
3. glen
